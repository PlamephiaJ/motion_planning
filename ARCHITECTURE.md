# Motion-planning module guide

`RRT` is the ROS2 orchestration layer. Planning and control algorithms live in
small modules so they can be changed and tested without constructing a ROS
node. Public headers contain the detailed input, output, mutation, and boundary
contracts for every interface.

## One global-pose update data flow

1. A fixed-period planning callback reads `map -> base_link` from TF and passes
   that pose to `RRT::update_global_pose()`. There is no source-specific pose
   subscription; simulator and real-car localization have the same interface.
2. `reference_path::Manager::update()` projects trajectory progress and creates
   the forward global goal plus local optimal reference.
3. If the optimal arc is clear, the local optimal reference is used directly.
4. If it is blocked, `rrt_star::Planner::plan()` builds a local detour to the
   same progress-based global goal.
5. `ReferenceTrajectory` associates every local optimal or RRT point with the
   nominal speed interpolated from the same CSV position/speed samples.
6. The configured steering controller and speed controller independently
   consume that paired local path. Enabled safety limiters are composed by
   taking the minimum speed.
7. `RRT` publishes the path/tree markers and Ackermann command.

The configured `odometry_topic` is a separate vehicle-state input. Its
`twist.twist.linear.x` and `twist.twist.angular.z` update current speed and yaw
rate; its pose is deliberately ignored and never participates in localization.

The optimal trajectory precomputes segment and cumulative arc lengths once.
After the first global projection, progress updates search only the configured
backward/forward arc window. A global projection is retried only when the local
projection is farther than `PROJECTION_FALLBACK_DISTANCE`.

While in RRT-detour mode, returning to the optimal reference requires all three
conditions in the same update:

- the optimal arc from current progress to the global goal is collision-free;
- distance from the vehicle to the optimal projection is no greater than
  `OPTIMAL_REJOIN_DISTANCE`;
- the direct short connector from the vehicle to that projection is clear.

Laser scans follow a separate short flow:

1. `dynamic_obstacles::valid_hit_points()` filters ranges and creates
   laser-frame hit points.
2. `RRT` applies TF because frame lookup is a ROS responsibility.
3. `RRT` retains sampled scans in a short rolling time window, rebuilds the
   dynamic layer at a configured fixed rate, and expires only old frames.

No planner subscribes to another vehicle's global pose. A moving vehicle is
just another obstacle observed by the current vehicle's own LiDAR. When RRT*
cannot find a detour, the node measures the arc distance to the first occupied
point on its blocked optimal reference and applies a proportional speed cap. It
therefore slows or stops using only its own perception. Returning from RRT mode
also requires all safe-rejoin conditions to remain continuously true for the
configured clearance time, which rejects one-frame obstacle dropouts.

## Interface contract convention

Each public declaration documents:

- **Input**: coordinate frame, units, required ranges, and ownership;
- **Return**: meaning of the value and failure representation;
- **Operation**: state or argument mutation, when applicable;
- **Boundary behavior**: invalid maps, empty paths, out-of-range coordinates,
  short paths, and rejected samples.

Algorithm modules do not publish ROS messages, query TF, or log. Those effects
remain in `RRT`, which makes module tests deterministic and keeps optimization
work localized.

## Running two vehicles

Configuration is split by responsibility:

- `config/rrt_common.yaml` contains environment-independent planner,
  reference-path, and fallback-control parameters;
- `config/rrt_sim.yaml` contains simulator topics, namespaces, exact frame IDs,
  waypoint source, vehicle/controller tuning, speeds, and colors;
- `config/rrt_real.yaml` contains the corresponding real-car interfaces and
  conservative initial speeds.

`launch/rrt.launch.py` recursively merges the selected environment file over
the common file. `launch/rrt_sim.launch.py` and `launch/rrt_real.launch.py` are
the normal entry points. Both accept `waypoint_file:=/absolute/path.csv`; the
override keeps workstation- and map-specific paths out of shared planner
settings. The real launch intentionally requires this override so simulator
waypoints cannot be used accidentally.

`rrt.launch.py` accepts a `launch.vehicles` list in the selected environment
YAML. Set `launch.vehicle_mode` to `1` to launch only the first enabled vehicle,
or to `2` to launch the first two. It starts a separate `rrt_node_sim` process for
each selected car. The parameters under `rrt_node.ros__parameters` are shared
by all instances, while each vehicle's `ros__parameters` override its waypoint
file, TF frames, odometry-state, scan, drive, dynamic-map, and control topics.
The command-line `waypoint_file` argument remains a global override and replaces
the configured waypoint file for every launched vehicle.

The shipped `config/rrt_sim.yaml` connects the two default gym agents as follows:

| RRT namespace | Global pose TF | Laser scan | Drive command | Start/stop control |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/ego_racecar` | `map -> ego_racecar/base_link` | `/scan` | `/drive` | `/ego_racecar/control` |
| `/opp_racecar` | `map -> opp_racecar/base_link` | `/opp_scan` | `/opp_drive` | `/opp_racecar/control` |

The real configuration uses the existing root-namespace interfaces
`/scan`, `/map`, and `/drive`, and obtains its global pose from
`map -> base_link`. Exact `map_frame`, `laser_frame`, and `vehicle_frame`
values are separated in each environment configuration and consumed directly
by TF lookup.

Each vehicle entry also owns its `SPEED_STRAIGHT`, `SPEED_MEDIUM_TURN`, and
`SPEED_SHARP_TURN` values in metres per second. The shared low/medium steering
thresholds select between those three levels. Speed values must satisfy
`straight >= medium turn >= sharp turn > 0`.

Controller selection is independent:

- `STEERING_CONTROLLER_TYPE: legacy_pure_pursuit` preserves the original
  fixed-lookahead `motion_planning` behavior; `pure_pursuit` selects the
  fy-code forward-sample implementation and its speed-dependent lookahead.
- `SPEED_CONTROLLER_TYPE: steering_band` preserves the original three speed
  bands; `trajectory` uses the CSV nominal speed plus fy-code forward braking
  preview. The latter requires an `x,y,speed` CSV.
- `CURVATURE_SPEED_LIMITER_ENABLED` independently applies the fy-code lateral
  acceleration formula to the actual RRT detour path only.
- `BLOCKED_PATH_SPEED_LIMITER_ENABLED` controls the existing LiDAR-only safety
  cap. It is enabled by default.

The shipped defaults select the newly integrated `pure_pursuit`, `trajectory`,
curvature limiting on, and blocked-path limiting on. Reverting to the previous
behavior remains a configuration-only operation: select
`legacy_pure_pursuit`, `steering_band`, and disable curvature limiting. For
legacy speed-band operation an `x,y` CSV remains accepted; its internal
nominal-speed entries are filled with `SPEED_STRAIGHT` solely to preserve the
paired-path invariant.

Each vehicle also has an RGB `VISUALIZATION_PRIMARY_COLOR` for its path, goal,
and RRT branches, plus a `VISUALIZATION_ACCENT_COLOR` for its lookahead point
and RRT nodes. The default ego palette is blue/cyan and the opponent palette is
orange/magenta.

Both nodes share `/map`, but keep their dynamic maps and all relative
visualization topics inside their own namespaces. Each vehicle's configured TF
frames identify its `base_link` and `laser`; no pose topic or localization
implementation is part of the planning interface. The original single-car
`launch.namespace` YAML format is still supported when `launch.vehicles` is
absent.

With the default safety setting (`start_on_launch: false`), the per-vehicle
topics still start or stop one car independently. The repository-level
`startrun.sh` and `stoprun.sh` publish one message to `/rrt/control`, which both
RRT nodes subscribe to, so the two commands share one publisher and DDS sample:

```bash
ros2 topic pub --once /ego_racecar/control std_msgs/msg/String "{data: start}"
ros2 topic pub --once /opp_racecar/control std_msgs/msg/String "{data: start}"
ros2 topic pub --once /ego_racecar/control std_msgs/msg/String "{data: stop}"
ros2 topic pub --once /opp_racecar/control std_msgs/msg/String "{data: stop}"
./startrun.sh
./stoprun.sh
./startrun.sh ego
./stoprun.sh ego
./startrun.sh opp
./stoprun.sh opp
```

With no argument, each script controls all running vehicles through the shared
topic. The publisher waits until both RRT subscribers have been discovered
before sending the single shared command. Pass `ego`/`1` or `opp`/`2` to
control only that vehicle.
